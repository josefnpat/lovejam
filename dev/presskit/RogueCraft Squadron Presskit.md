### History

#### Early Development

Started out as as a game jam prototype from the LÖVE Jam ([download it here](https://missingsentinelsoftware.com/game/roguecraft-squadron)) in February 2017. The game was a level-based, permadeath, space RTS with the ability to unlock and upgrade your ships.

#### Current

March 2018, after the SXSW Gaming Expo, we decided to pivot the game, going from the level based system to a more open system that would also allow for multiplayer matches. This allowed the game to have configurable maps and expand on the number strategies available to the players. We brought in artist NoyemiK to create character art for the storyline of RogueCraft Squadron, which included humans and aliens. We also brought in composer Ran Schonewille to work on dynamic music tracks. This created a more immersive experience for the player as the music would intensify with conflict and fleet growth.
