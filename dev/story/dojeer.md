## Dojeer

A race of plant based hiveminds, a Dojeer hive's foremost goal is to grow. They are a dangerous, antagonistic species that spreads itself round the universe by overgrowing planets, choking out their competition, and scavenging other race's tech for their own use. And to a Dojeer hive, each a unique personality, everything is competition, even other hives. 

Every hive can be traced back to their home planet, which seems to be the only place that actually produces new hive seeds. These seeds to launched out of that planet's atmosphere and drifts through space until they land on a new planet. 

As the Dojeer Hive Seed grows it's roots will sprout the Pod plants which will in turn bear the Gathers, the Guards, the Scouts and the Drones. These beings might look alive and autonomous but they are all being controlled by a single entity that sees through all of their senses simultaneously.  A Dojeer colony isn't a city, but a body made of millions of mobile creations. To speak to one Dojeer Drone, or Gather, or "building" is to speak to the being that is that hivemind. Because of this, the Dojeer hivemind doesn't have a sense of time beyond the present. To the hivemind covering a planet it is simultaneously dawn, midnight, noon, and twilight all at the same time. Their way to mark their own memory's timeline is by comparing their present state of growth with their past state of growth.

The Dojeer hives can develop a space force, usually comprised of captured ships that have been overgrown in hive growth. This space force is usually used as protection for the Hive's planet, keeping close and remaining under the direct control of that Hive's personality. Rarely, a Hive will launch a force as a scouting or resource gathering tactic, with the personality copying itself on these vessels and being reabsorbed into it's main personality upon re-entry into it's solar system. These trips are usually short.

**Appearance Details**

No mouth

make the drone look more like it is made of plant matter.

wilder hair (maybe made of plant strands, but I'd leave that up to the artist)

make the horns/antennas look more plant-like (maybe fern fronds)

Make the two Dojeer designs similar enough that they look alike in silhouette but different when revealed

Mati design suggestions: woody colors, sharper design elements. Pointy fingers? 

Algos design suggestions: brighter, greener colors, current design softness is good.

### Mati Dojeer

Thorns, spikes, bark, wood

Old experienced hivemind. (should look physically formidable individually)

Violent but careful. calculating, methodical, uncaring, but logical. Willing to live and let live, even work with those outside of itself if absolutely necessary. Not someone you would want to show weakness, but not the sort of individual to kill someone on a whim. Views war as a drain on resources for it's future and is not something it wants.

Colonized a very difficult planet. had to deal with lots of obstacles to it's growth. Learned to grow carefully and to value it's bodies and resources. Values enemies as something to test and grow against. 

### 

### Algos Dojeer 

Green. Petels. Poison.  

Young. Violent. Wasteful. Single minded. Greedy.

Came from a very lush planet that was easy to grow on. Overgrew it too fast, sucked all the nutrients out of it's soil and make the planet into an arid wasteland. Pulled it's drones and Prime Tree off their first planet and is now pillaging it's way though the system. Spends its resources and troops recklessly having never learned to plan and conserve resources.
