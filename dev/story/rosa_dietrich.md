### Rosa Dietrich (Mars Colony)

Support Commander

Age: ~20

Backstory: Rosa was a famous, and wealthy, child star on Mars. Wanting to do something in her life that mattered and to get away from the hype that surrounded her on Mars, Rosa joined the ICH military  as a port of their support crew at 18. She worked hard at her jobs, impressing those around her with her organizational and leadership skills, but she's had a hard time getting people to taker her seriously when they first meet her. She was appointed to Support Commander for this mission, and this is her first time commanding the entire support crew.

Personality: She works hard at her job, has developed a chip on her shoulder about people dismissing her as a silly actor child pretending to be a leader. She tries not to jump down people's throats when they bring it up, but she will cut people off if they bring it up.

Trait /Skills: Applying lessons from previous experiences. Organizing and finding the right people for a job.

Strengths: Ambitious, straight forward. A good boss. Very present focused.

Weaknesses: Gets aggravated with people who bring up her childhood and teenage work. Constantly feels like she needs to prove herself.
