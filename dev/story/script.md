# RogueCraft Squadron Campaign

**THIS IS A ROUGHT DRAFT AND NEEDS A LOT OF CLEANUP. ALL CRITIQUE AND CRITICISM WELCOME!**

## Script:

## Level 1 Prelude

**Adjutant:** Private message 67/67, time delay of one week and two days.

**Grace Patton:** Ruby; all my life I wanted out. I've always wanted... I don't know. I wanted to leave everything behind, but I had to be there for you.

Here I am. I couldn't be there for you. It's cold and the air is getting thin. Life support has failed.

I don't want you to be sad or angry. I just wanted to protect you, but now ...

There's nothing I can do to save you.

I tried my best, spent years studying to get to the top of my class so I could keep us safe. Then you followed me, I don't know why. Get out, get out while you can.

Get out for me, get out for yourself, I don't care. I ... I love you Ruby.

**Ruby Patton:** Gracie - what did you do? How bad have things been out there?

Adjutant, what happened to the USS Bishop?

**Adjutant:** USS Bishop is captained by Grace Patton. Current status is classified.

**Ruby Patton:** She had the best ship in the fleet. What happened?

What is Miho Takeda's current status?

**Adjutant:** Miho Takeda is currently in wargames.

**Ruby Patton:** Adjutant, open private message with Miho Takeda.

**Miho Takeda:** Takeda here. Squadron Commander Patton, what can I do for you?

**Ruby Patton:** Takeda-san. You have a moment?

**Miho Takeda:** Sure, we've taken a short break from wargames. We're going to recommence soon, but I have some time.

**Ruby Patton:** Miho, I've received a troubling message from Grace.

**Miho Takeda:** Miho ... you've not called me that in a while. I heard about your sister.

I don't know much more than you; it's above my pay grade. I can tell you she was on an active mission, but she's missing in action now. I know you two are close and what she meant to you. I'm sure if she died, she died doing her duty to the Imperial Earth Empire.

**Ruby Patton:** Did they find the ship?

**Miho Takeda:** She made a formal report along with the personal message that you got. The report was mostly above my grade, but ... we don't think she made it. I'm sorry Ruby.

**Ruby Patton:** ...

**Miho Takeda:** There are new active orders. All of my squadrons, including yours, have been moved to the front line against the Dojeer. We might be following in her footsteps. We've lost a lot of good people. I promise you, we're going to make them pay.

**Ruby Patton:** Thanks Miho. I haven't given up on her yet.

**Miho Takeda:** Your orders are to move to the front lines. You will be receiving a Lieutenant to support you, Rosa Dietrich. She's green, but he shows a lot of promise. She will convey the mission specifics.

And Ruby... I'm sorry for your loss.

Takeda out.

**Rosa Dietrich:** Squadron Commander, Lieutenant Dietrich reporting in.

**Ruby Patton:** At ease, lieutenant. What's the situation report?

**Rosa Dietrich:** We will encounter enemy forces, the Dojeer. They've entered the forward line. Should they be hostile, we are to defend the sector at all costs. We have a command ship available to us. We should be prepared to gather resources so that we can construct a fleet.

**Ruby Patton:** And what has happened to our support?

**Rosa Dietrich:** Sir, the other squadrons in the fleet are engaged in other sectors. We're on our own.

## Level 1 Mission

* 1 v 1 easy

## Level 1 Complete

**Rosa Dietrich:** I am please to report that we have destroyed all the hostile enemies.

**Ruby Patton:** Don't get ahead of yourself, Lieutenant. This was just too easy. Past reports have shown that the Dojeer have superior technology.

**Rosa Dietrich:** When I first joined, I was worried. We were facing the unknown, but now I think we can win this war.

**Ruby Patton:** I heard you were an actor before joining the military.

**Rosa Dietrich:** Sir ... yes I was, but don't think that makes me unqualified. I resent that you bring up my history, it makes me feel like you think I'm unprepared.

**Ruby Patton:** I ...

**Rosa Dietrich:** I have served on many ships and I have surpassed expectations. Everything I have done has been on the merit of my ability.

**Ruby Patton:** I didn't mean to offend, Rosa. Takeda has nothing but high praise and I trust in her judgment.

**Rosa Dietrich:** I'm sorry, sir. I ... Usually people question my ability, because I used to be an actor.

## Level 2 Prelude

**Miho Takeda:** Patton, Report.

**Ruby Patton:** This sector has been secured, Wing Commander.

**Miho Takeda:** Nikolai, Report.

**Valentina Nikolai**: All hostiles have been removed from the adjacent sector.

**Miho Takeda:** Good work, commanders. Your next mission requires a joint effort. We have detected a larger presence of Dojeer in the next sector. You two are to secure that sector. I will be moving into an adjacent sector in hopes of engaging in a pincer attack.

**Ruby Patton:** Any new intelligence on the Dojeer?

**Valentina Nikolai**: The Dojeer have begin to improve their tactics and strategy. They are adapting.

**Ruby Patton:** And what of the USS Bishop?

**Valentina Nikolai**: Unfortunately, no new information.

**Miho Takeda:** Takeda out.

**Valentina Nikolai**: Commander, I am very excited to work with you. I have heard great things about you.

**Ruby Patton:** I have heard of your unorthodox conquests as well.

**Valentina Nikolai**: *Laughs* Yes, yes yes. The time I used troopships to take over enemy vessels. Good times! I am prepared for this mission! If it is our day to die, then it is our day to die.

**Ruby Patton:** See you on the battlefield.

## Level 2 Mission

- 2 v 2 easy

## Level 2 Complete

**Rosa Dietrich:** Commander, we are receiving a message from the Dojeer.

**Dojeer:** [foreign text]

Grace Patton

[foreign text]

**Rosa Dietrich:** Grace Patton? Your sister? What does it all mean?

**Ruby Patton:** I ... I don't know.

## Level 3 Prelude

**Miho Takeda:** Report.

**Valentina Nikolai**: Mission was great success. The enemy is cunning, but we will be victorious.

**Ruby Patton:** We are receiving messages from the Dojeer. We have no translations.

**Valentina Nikolai**: The Dojeer say funny things. It's all gibberish, so why bother listening?

**Ruby Patton:** They said Grace's name ...

**Miho Takeda:** We've been trying to open up formal communications with the Dojeer. It's disturbing that they know her name. Continue recording incoming messages from the Dojeer and send them to central command. We're moving to the next sector. Nikolai, you shall move to the adjacent sector, and I will be in the other. Keep moving forward, Patton.

## Level 3 Mission

* 1 v 2 medium (unallied, e.g. 1v1v1)

## Level 3 Complete

**Rosa Dietrich:** More messages from the Dojeer incoming.

**Dojeer 1:** [foreign text]

**Dojeer 2:** [foreign text]

**Dojeer 1:** [foreign text]

**Ruby Patton:** Are they fighting? What's going on?

## Level 4 Prelude

**Miho Takeda:** Patton, this is a secure channel. I've just talked to Nikolai. I'm going to be honest with you, we're losing this war. We're doing well on this front, but the other fleets are getting splattered on the metaphorical windshield. 

In the 20th century, bombs like the Tasar Bomba at 50 megatons were bragging rights. Of course once you get to this payload, the application becomes racial genocide. You might as well just blow it up in your backyard because every living thing on the planet is going to die.

Now to the point. Imperial Earth Empire has built two 1,000 megaton thermonuclear weapons. Teller Mark 42. These bombs are the biggest we as a species have ever made. We're giving you our last one. We've modified your ship so that you can take cover in anti-radiation chambers for when you launch it.

**Ruby Patton:** Are we trying to take advantage while the Dojeer fight each other?

**Miho Takeda:** Exactly. Even with this, we're losing this war. At this point it's them or us. I pray that with Nikolai supporting you, you will end this war and come back alive. You mission is to go directly to the Dojeer home world, Hoft, and eradicate the Dojeer at all costs.

**Ruby Patton:** Into the valley of death we ride. It's been an honor serving with you, Takeda-san.

**Miho Takeda:** The honor is all mine. Takeda out.

## Level 4 Mission

* 2 v 2 medium

## Level 4 Complete

**Rosa Dietrich:** Commander, incoming message from the Dojeer.

**Dojeer:** [foreign text]

**Rosa Dietrich:** Sir, we've gotten a basic translation algorithm from central command. Attempting auto translation.

**Dojeer:** We are not here because we choose to be, but because we are destined to be here. Time is of no consequence; all that matters is causality. It is not our place to attempt to deviate because we cannot. You are to die.

## Level 5 Prelude

**Rosa Dietrich:** Sir, good news and bad news. Good news is that we seem to have a small force of Dojeer cornered in this system. 

**Ruby Patton:** This deep in space? Let's take them out as quickly as we can and move on. Bad news?

**Rosa Dietrich:** Bad news is that I cannot hail Takeda. Intelligence reports that she may have fallen in battle.

**Ruby Patton:** Oh Miho. It is not their place make reply, not to reason why, but only to do and die.

## Level 5 Mission

* 1 v 1 hard
* Start survival mode when less than three ships for enemy. Victory when your command ship takes damage.

## Level 5 Complete

**Rosa Dietrich:** Sir; there's too many of them!

**Grace Patton:** This is the USS Biship. We've detected a massive fleet surrounding this sector!

**Ruby Patton:** Gracie, is that you?

**Grace Patton:** Yes. It's Grace.

**Ruby Patton:** Grace. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I couldn't find you sooner.

**Grace Patton:** No. I am the one who will to protect you. There's no time - prepare for a radiological explosion.

This has happened before and it will happen again. Remember that.

**Rosa Dietrich:** She's firing a warhead! Teller Mark 2 class! Everyone to the radiation chambers!

**Ruby Patton:** Gracie!

## Level 6 Prelude

**Rosa Dietrich:** She did it. She killed them all. She must have had the other Teller Mark 42 Miho mentioned. She ... sacrificed herself for us.

**Ruby Patton:** No, Miho. Was there no other way? Miho ...

**Rosa Dietrich:** Incoming!

## Level 6 Mission

* 1 v 2 hard

## Level 6 Complete

**Valentina Nikolai**: Nikolai reporting in.

**Ruby Patton:** Valentina ... I thought we had lost you!

**Valentina Nikolai**: You can't keep a good soldier down! We were slowed down, but have caught up! We're prepared to meet you in the next!

## Level 7 Prelude

**Rosa Dietrich:** We're detecting a lot of enemies in this sector! We're getting ... an open communication with the Dojeer!

**Dojeer:**  It is our place to experience life instinctually. A desire to survive is a reason to live, but not to exist. We fight you because that is what we do and desire, but this is not something we choose to do.

**Ruby Patton:** I don't understand. If it's not your desire, why do you fight?

**Dojeer:** Just as it was not Grace Patton's desire to kill us, she chose to do so anyway. Why did she fight?

**Rosa Dietrich:** Incoming!

## Level 7 Mission

* 2 v 3 hard

## Level 7 Complete

**Valentina Nikolai**: Sector secure! I will take point for the next sector. We are approaching their home world. You have the Teller, you must persist. Effect repairs, join us as soon as you can - we will make a wide berth for you.

**Ruby Patton:** Good luck Valentina. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

**Valentina Nikolai**: Today, we will be victorious, or die fighting to the last.

## Level 8 Prelude

**Rosa Dietrich:** There's no sign of Nikolai! Hostiles incoming!

**Ruby Patton:** Valentina ... No. Not you too...

**Dojeer:** You are not prepared for what you have seen and what you will see. As time begins and as time ends, you will understand your death.

## Level 8 Mission

* 1 v 2 hard

## Level 8 Complete

**Rosa Dietrich:** Commander - we've got intelligence that the Dojeer are only a few sectors from Earth!

**Ruby Patton:** I have been fighting for so long. We have been fighting for the survival of the human race. Today we will destroy the Dojeer or they will destroy us.

**Rosa Dietrich:** Incoming communication from the Dojeer!

**Mati:** I am Mati.

I am not here for your life as much as you are not here to die.

I was Dojeer. We are now Mati and Algos. Now we are two.

I am not your enemy. Although I kill, I kill to protect and maintain.

Algos is blind with rage. This rage blinds his vision of the past, the present and the future.

**Ruby Patton:** There's two of you? Algos must have killed Takeda!

**Mati:** Yes. Mati will be friend to humans. Algos must die or humans will die.

**Ruby Patton:** But ... what about ... Grace?

**Mati:** Grace was meant to end the war. Grace failed and Algos found a big bomb. Algos tried use big bomb on Mati.

**Ruby Patton:** But ... Grace saved me with the bomb. She died protecting me!

**Mati:** No, Grace died here.

**Rosa Dietrich:** Commander, we've received telemetry for a ship ... it's the USS Bishop! The ship ... there's no one left.

**Mati:** Grace could not understand, Mati defended Dojeer.

**Ruby Patton:** Then who saved me?

**Mati:** You did. This has happened before and it will happen again.

**Rosa Dietrich:** There's a ... unstable wormhole forming!

**Mati:** Take big bomb through time portal. Destroy Algos. If not for Dojeer, if not for Takeda, for memory of Grace. Become Grace, so that you may succeed.

**Ruby Patton:** I have no choice.

Tear off the hull markings. Change our identifiers to match the USS Bishop. Disconnect the video feed from the communications systems.

**Rosa Dietrich:** What?

**Ruby Patton:** Grace never completed her mission. Mission command gave her the other Teller Mark 2. Without Grace, we must take her place in time.

**Rosa Dietrich:** Yes sir.

**Ruby Patton:** When you're done, we're heading in.

## Level 9 Prelude

**Miho Takeda:** Grace? Grace Patton? Is that you?

**Ruby Patton:** Yes.

**Miho Takeda:** It's good to see you, but we've got incoming!

## Level 9 Mission

* 2 v 3 hard

## Level 9 Complete

**Rosa Dietrich:** Sir! Takeda's reactor has been damaged!

**Miho Takeda:** Grace ... your sister is looking for you.

**Rosa Dietrich:** It's gone critical and it's about to blow!

**Ruby Patton:** Miho, I'm sorry. I can't save you.

**Miho Takeda:** That voice. Ruby? Is that you?

**Ruby Patton:** Miho ...

**Rosa Dietrich:** They ... they're gone.

**Ruby Patton:** We're ending this. Let's go.

**Rosa Dietrich:** Navigating through the portal.

**Ruby Patton:** Rosa.

I saw your movies, you know. Your last one ... even made me cry.

**Rosa Dietrich:** That ... means a lot to me.

**Ruby Patton:** We shall not go gentle into the night.

**Rosa Dietrich:** We're through the wormhole! Incoming message!

**Past Ruby Patton:** Gracie, is that you?

**Future Ruby Patton:** Yes. It's Grace.
