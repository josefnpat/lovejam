# RogueCraft Squadron Campaign

## Script:

## Level 1 Prelude

**Adjutant:** Incoming Message for Ruby Patton, time delay of one week and two days.

*todo: make sure the player realizes this message is an anomaly, and is only for Ruby*

**Grace Patton:** Ruby. All my life I wanted out. I've always wanted. I don't know. I wanted to leave, but I also wanted to be there for you.

I couldn't be there for you, but I left anyway. Here I am. It's cold and the air is getting thin, I can tell.

I don't want you to be sad or worry. I just wanted to protect you, but now there's nothing I can do. There's nothing I can do to save you.

I tried my best, spent years studying to get to the top of my class for you. But then you followed me, I don't know why. Get out, get out while you can. Get out for me. I love you Ruby.

**Ruby Patton:** Gracie - what did you do? How bad have things been out there?

Adjutant, what happened to the [Grace Patton's Ship]

**Adjutant:** [Grace Patton's Ship] is appointed to Grace Patton. Current status is classified.

**Ruby Patton:** She had the best ship in the fleet. What happened?

What is Miho Takeda's current status?

**Adjutant:** Miho Takeda is currently in wargames.

**Ruby Patton:** Adjutant, open secure communications with Miho Takeda.

**Miho Takeda:** Takeda here. Squadron Commander Patton, what can I do for you?

**Ruby Patton:** Takeda-san. You have a moment?

**Miho Takeda:** Sure, we've taken a short break from wargames. We're going to recommence soon, but I have some time.

**Ruby Patton:** Miho, I've received a troubling message from Grace.

**Miho Takeda:** Miho ... you've not called me that in a while. I heard about your sister. I don't know much more than you; it's above my pay grade. I can tell you she was on an active mission, but she's missing in action now. I know you two are close, and what she meant to you. I'm sure if she died, she died doing her duty to the Imperial Earth Empire.

**Ruby Patton:** Did they find the ship?

**Miho Takeda:** She made a formal report along with the personal message that you got. The report was mostly above my head, but we don't think she made it. I'm sorry Ruby.

There's new active orders. All of my squadrons, including yours,  have been moved to the front line against the Dojeer. We might be following in her footsteps. We've lost a lot of good people. We're going to make them pay.

**Ruby Patton:** Thanks Miho.

**Miho Takeda:** Your orders are to move to the front lines. You will be receiving a Lieutenant to support you, Rosa Dietrich. He's green, but he shows a lot of promise. She will convey the mission specifics. Takeda out.

**Rosa Dietrich:** Squadron Commander, Lieutenant Dietrich reporting in.

**Ruby Patton:** At ease, lieutenant. What's the situation report?

**Rosa Dietrich:** We will encounter enemy forces, the Dojeer. They've entered the forward line. Should they be hostile, we are to defend the sector at all costs. We have a command ship available to us. We should be prepared to gather resources so that we can construct a fleet.

**Ruby Patton:** And what has happened to our support?

**Rosa Dietrich:** Sir, only the command ship can get through the wormholes - the other squadrons in the fleet are engaged in other sectors.

## Level 1 Mission

* 1 v 1 easy

## Level 1 Complete

**Rosa Dietrich:** I am please to report that we have destroyed all the hostile enemies.

**Ruby Patton:** Don't get ahead of yourself, Lieutenant. This was just too easy. Past reports have shown that the Dojeer have superior technology.

**Rosa Dietrich:** When I first joined, I was worried. We were facing the unknown, but now I think we can win this war.

**Ruby Patton:** I heard you were an actor before joining the military.

**Rosa Dietrich:** I was, but don't think that makes me unqualified, sir. I resent that you bring up my history, it makes me feel like you think I'm unprepared.

**Ruby Patton:** I ...

**Rosa Dietrich:** I have served on many ships, and I have surpassed expectations. Everything I have done has been on the merit of my ability.

**Ruby Patton:** I didn't mean to offend, Rosa. Takeda had told me you were talented, and I agree.

**Rosa Dietrich:** I'm sorry, sir. I ... Usually people question my ability, because I used to be an actor.

## Level 2 Prelude

**Miho Takeda:** Patton, Report.

**Ruby Patton:** This sector has been secured, Wing Commander.

**Miho Takeda:** Nikolai, Report.

**Valentina Nikolai**: Nikolai reports that all hostiles have been removed from the adjacent sector.

**Miho Takeda:** Good work, commanders. Your next mission requires a joint effort. We have detected a larger presence of Dojeer in the next sector. You two are to secure that sector. I will be moving into an adjacent sector in hopes of engaging in a pincer attack.

**Ruby Patton:** Any new intelligence on the Dojeer?

**Valentina Nikolai**: The Dojeer have begin to improve their tactics and strategy. They are adapting.

**Ruby Patton:** And what of the [Grace's Ship Name]

**Valentina Nikolai**: Unfortunately, no new information.

**Miho Takeda:** Takeda out.

**Valentina Nikolai**: Commander, I am very excited to work with you. I have heard great things about you.

**Ruby Patton:** I have heard of your unorthodox conquests as well.

**Valentina Nikolai**: *laughs* Yes, yes yes. The time I used troopships to take over enemy vessels. Good times! I am prepared for this mission! If it is our day to die, then it is our day to die. Let's kick some ass!

**Ruby Patton:** See you on the battlefield.

## Level 2 Mission

- 2 v 2 easy

## Level 2 Complete

**Rosa Dietrich:** Commander, we are receiving a message from the Dojeer.

**Dojeer:** [foreign text]

Grace Patton

[foreign text]

**Rosa Dietrich:** Grace Patton? Your sister? What does it all mean?

**Ruby Patton:** I don't know.

## Level 3 Prelude

**Miho Takeda:** Report.

**Valentina Nikolai**: Mission was great success. The enemy is becoming harder, but we will be victorious.

**Ruby Patton:** We received a strange message from the Dojeer.

**Valentina Nikolai**: Dojeer says funny things. We never know what they talk, we can't listen.

**Ruby Patton:** They said Grace's name ...

**Miho Takeda:** We've been trying to open up formal communications with the Dojeer. It's interesting that they know her name. Continue recording incoming messages from the Dojeer, and send them to central command. We're moving to the next sector. Nikolai, you shall move to the adjacent sector, and I will be in the other. Keep moving forward, Patton.

## Level 3 Mission

* 1 v 2 medium (unallied, e.g. 1v1v1)

## Level 3 Complete

**Rosa Dietrich:** More messages incoming.

**Dojeer 1:** [foreign text]

**Dojeer 2:** [foreign text]

**Dojeer 1:** [foreign text]

**Ruby Patton:** Are they fighting? What's going on?

## Level 4 Prelude

**Miho Takeda:** Patton, this is a secure channel. I've just talked to Nikolai. I'm going to be honest with you, we're losing this war. We're doing well on this front, but the other fleets are getting splattered on the metaphorical windshield. 

In the 20th century, bombs like the Tasar Bomba at 50 Megatons became bragging rights. Once you get to this size, the application becomes racial genocide. Once you have a bomb of this size, you might as well just blow it up in your back yard, because everything on the planet is going to die.

Now to the point. Imperial Earth Empire has built two 1,000 Megaton Thermonuclear weapons. Teller Mark 42. These bombs are the biggest we have ever made. We're giving you our last one. We've modified your ship so that you can take cover in anti-radiation chambers.

**Ruby Patton:** Are we trying to take advantage while the Dojeer fight each other?

**Miho Takeda:** Exactly. Even with this, we're losing this war. At this point it's them or us. I pray that with Nikolai supporting you, you will end this war and come back alive. You mission is to go directly to Hoft, and eradicate the Dojeer at all costs.

**Ruby Patton:** Into the valley of death we ride. It's been an honor serving with you, Takeda-san.

**Miho Takeda:** The honor is all mine.

## Level 4 Mission

* 2 v 2 medium

## Level 4 Complete

**Rosa Dietrich:** Commander, incoming message from the Dojeer.

**Dojeer:** [foreign text]

**Rosa Dietrich:** Sir, we've gotten a basic translation algorithm from central command. Attempting auto translation.

**Dojeer:** We are not here because we choose to be, but because we are destined to be here. All that has happened, has happened before, and will happen again. It is not our place to attempt to deviate, because we cannot. You are to die.

## Level 5 Prelude

**Rosa Dietrich:** Sir. it looks like we have a small force cornered!

**Rosa Dietrich:** Sir, good news and bad news. Good news is that we seem to have a small force of Dojeer to contend with in this system. 

**Ruby Patton:** This deep in space? Let's take them out as quickly as we can, and move on. Bad news?

**Rosa Dietrich:** Bad news is that I cannot hail Takeda. Intelligence reports that she may have been defeated in battle.

**Ruby Patton:** Oh Miho. Theirs not to make reply, theirs not to reason why, theirs but to do and die.

## Level 5 Mission

* 1 v 1 hard
* Start survival mode when less than three ships for enemy. Victory when your command ship takes damage.

## Level 5 Complete

**Rosa Dietrich:** Sir; there's too many of them!

**Grace Patton:** This is the [Grace's Ship Name]. We've detected a massive fleet surrounding this sector!

**Ruby Patton:** Gracie, is that you?

**Grace Patton:** Yes. It's Grace.

**Ruby Patton:** I'm sorry. I'm sorry I couldn't find you sooner.

**Grace Patton:** No. I was the one who will to protect you. There's no time - prepare for a radiological explosion.

**Rosa Dietrich:** What?

**Grace Patton:** All that has happened, will happen before, and will happen again.

**Rosa Dietrich:** She's firing a Teller MK 2! Everyone to the radiation chambers!

**Ruby Patton:** Gracie!

## Level 6 Prelude

**Rosa Dietrich:** She did it. She killed them all. She must have had the other Teller Mark 42. She ... sacrificed herself for us.

**Ruby Patton:** I ... I don't know what ...

**Rosa Dietrich:** Incoming!

## Level 6 Mission

* 1 v 2 hard

## Level 6 Complete

**Valentina Nikolai**: We have caught up to your sector! We're prepared to meet you in the next!

## Level 7 Prelude

**Rosa Dietrich:** We're detecting a lot of enemies in this sector! We're getting ... an open communication with the Dojeer!

**Dojeer:**  It is our place to experience life instinctually. A desire to survive is a reason to live, but not to exist. We fight you because that is what we do and desire, but this is not something we choose to do.

**Ruby Patton:** I don't understand. If it's not your desire, why do you fight?

**Dojeer:**  Just as it was not Grace Patton's desire to kill us, she chose to do so anyway. Why did she fight?

## Level 7 Mission

* 2 v 3 hard

## Level 7 Complete

**Valentina Nikolai**: Sector secure! I will take point for the next sector. We are approaching their home world. You have the Teller, you must persist. Effect repairs, join us as soon as you can - we will make a wide berth for you.

**Ruby Patton:** Good luck Valentina. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

**Valentina Nikolai**: Today, we will be victorious, or die fighting to the last man.

## Level 8 Prelude

**Rosa Dietrich:** There's no sign of Nikolai! Hostiles incoming!

**Ruby Patton:** Valentina. No.

**Dojeer:** You are not prepared for what you have seen, and what you will see. As time begins and as time ends, you will understand your death.

## Level 8 Mission

* 1 v 2 hard

## Level 8 Complete

**Rosa Dietrich:** Commander - we've got intelligence that the Dojeer are only a few sectors from Earth!

**Ruby Patton:** I have been fighting for so long. We are fighting for the survival of the human race. Today we will destroy the Dojeer, or they will destroy us.

**Dojeer:** All that has happened before, and will happen again. 

**Mati:** I am Mati.

I am not here for your life as much as you are not here to die.

I was Mati and Algos. Now we are two.

I am not your enemy. Although I kill, I kill to protect and maintain.

Algos is blind with rage. This rage blinds his vision of the past, the present and the future.

**Ruby Patton:** There's two of you! Algos must have killed Takeda!

**Mati:** Yes. Mati will be friend to humans. Algos must die or humans will die.

**Ruby Patton:** But ... what about ... Grace?

**Mati:** Grace was meant to end war. Instead of killing Algos, Algos tried to kill Mati with big bomb.

**Ruby Patton:** But ... Grace saved me with the bomb. She died protecting me!

**Mati:** No, Grace died here.

**Rosa Dietrich:** Commander, we've received telemetry for a ship ... it's the [Grace's ship name]! The ship ... there's no one left.

**Mati:** Grace could not understand, Mati defended Dojeer.

**Ruby Patton:** Then who saved me?

**Mati:** You did. All this has happened before, and will happen again.

**Rosa Dietrich:** There's a ... unstable wormhole forming!

**Mati:** Take big bomb through time portal. Destroy Algos. If not for Dojeer, if not for Takeda, for memory of Grace. Become Grace, so that you may succeed.

**Ruby Patton:** Tear off the hull markings. Change our identifiers to match the [Grace's Ship Name]. Disconnect the video feed from the communications systems.

**Rosa Dietrich:** What?

**Ruby Patton:** Grace never completed her mission. Mission command gave her the other bomb. Without Grace, we must take her place in history.

**Rosa Dietrich:** Yes sir.

**Ruby Patton:** When you're done, we're heading in.

## Level 9 Prelude

**Miho Takeda:** Grace? Grace Patton? Is that you?

**Ruby Patton:** Yes.

**Miho Takeda:** It's good to see you, but we've got incoming!

## Level 9 Mission

* 2 v 3 hard

## Level 9 Complete

**Rosa Dietrich:** Sir! Takeda's reactor has been damaged!

**Miho Takeda:** Grace ... your sister is looking for you.

**Rosa Dietrich:** It's gone critical and it's about to blow!

**Ruby Patton:** Miho, I'm sorry. I can't save you.

**Miho Takeda:** Ruby? Is that you?

**Ruby Patton:** Miho ...

**Rosa Dietrich:** They ... they're gone.

**Ruby Patton:** We're ending this. Let's go.

**Rosa Dietrich:** Navigating through the portal.

**Ruby Patton:** Rosa.

I saw your movies, you know. Your last one ... even made me cry.

**Rosa Dietrich:** That ... means a lot to me.

**Ruby Patton:** We shall not go gentle into the night.

**Rosa Dietrich:** We're through the wormhole! Incoming message!

[The following text must be exactly the same at the end]

**Ruby Patton:** Gracie, is that you?

**Not Grace Patton:** Yes. It's Grace.

**Ruby Patton:** I'm sorry. I'm sorry I couldn't find you sooner.

**Not Grace Patton:** No. I was the one who will to protect you. There's no time - prepare for a radiological explosion.

**Past Rosa Dietrich:** What?

**Not Grace Patton:** All that has happened, will happen before, and will happen again.

[The previous text must be exactly the same at the end]

**Future Rosa Dietrich:** Communications ended. Algos is here.

**Ruby Patton:** Detonate the Teller.
