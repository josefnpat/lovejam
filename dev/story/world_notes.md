## World Notes

We are now in the late 22nd century - humans have space flight and can navigate wormholes. Unfortunately, the technology for using wormholes is incredibly expensive, and instead of transferring whole fleets, one command ship is sent through, and then it gathers materials to build a squadron.

Ship terminology:

- Fleet > Squadron > Ship

Rank Terminology:

- Wing Commander
- Squadron Commander
- Flight Lieutenant
- Flying Officer
- Pilot Officer / Officer Cadet
