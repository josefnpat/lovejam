## World Notes

Set in 2116, innovations have made space flight a commercial commodity.

When the first colonies where founded on Mars the Earth's governments agreed to form the Interstellar Coalition of Humanity that would allow those colonies full representative rights once they could maintain their own infrastructure. Most Colonies are still small, but they do take pride in pulling their own weight among their more powerful counterparts. 

The discovery of naturally occurring wormholes opened up humanity's possibilities. The technology for navigating these wormholes is still prototyping stage and is incredibly expensive. 

The ICH, concerned that the wormholes could be used to attack Earth and It's territory, has organized a military force with the goal of colonizing the areas around the wormhole entrances, both for purposes of commerce and trade and to allow them to establish guard points.  

In an effort to keep costs low, the ICH sends one command ship through a wormhole, and then it gathers materials to build a squadron, set up defenses, and build a staging post to dock ships at.

These locations are at the cutting edge of Humanities frontier. The people who volunteer for these missions are the top of their field, and a little bit crazy on top of that. 

Ship terminology:

- Fleet > Squadron > Ship

Rank Terminology and hierarchy order:

- Fleet Commander
- Squadron Commander
- Support Commander
- Squad Officer
- Pilot / Cadet



The Workers ship was originally designed as an outpost/waystation before the dojeer attacked. It has since been restructured as a manufactory for any tools and parts needed by the command ship, and houses most of the Support and Supply Crew during conflict. It is run by the Support Commanders.
