msgstr "Similar to planetary nebulae, these emission nebula clouds are dense areas of ionized gas formed from a dying star. As the star begins to shed its outer layers and its hot core ionizes them the layers will sometimes cluster, forming a dense area of ionization. The IEE recommends using these to hide from enemy sensors and setting up ambushes."
