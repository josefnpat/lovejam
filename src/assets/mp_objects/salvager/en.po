msgstr "Scrappers are quite common nowadays, as space is a dangerous place to venture. This is a basic vulture ship designed to pick up scrap from destroyed enemies. It is a simple design, gets the job done and it's cheap to build. We should probably avoid putting claustrophobic folks in these guys."
