# RogueCraft Squadron Campaign

## Level 1 Prelude

### Chapter 1: The Long Goodbye

**Computer:** Private message 67 out of 67 from Commander Grace Patton. Communication delay of one week and two days.

Playing now.

**H|Grace Patton:** Ruby, I don't have much time. Keep an eye on the Dojeer. Hopefully this war will end soon.

If I don't come back ... tell Mom and Dad I love them.

Stay safe. I love you.

**Ruby Patton:** *Ruby chokes up*

Gracie - what did you do? How bad have things been out there?

Computer, what happened to the IEE Bishop?

**Computer:** IEE Bishop is captained by Grace Patton. Current status is classified.

**Ruby Patton:** She had the best ship in the fleet. What happened?

Computer, what is Miho Takeda's current status?

**Computer:** Fleet Commander Miho Takeda is currently in Sector 14 and within immediate communication range.

**Ruby Patton:** Computer, open a private message with Fleet Commander Takeda.

-- Adding DIY screen transition

**Computer:** Connection established.

**H|Miho Takeda:** Takeda here. Squadron Commander Patton, what can I do for you?

**Ruby Patton:** Fleet Commander Takeda, do you have a moment?

**H|Miho Takeda:** I do. We are going to recommence scouting soon, but I have some time right now.

**Ruby Patton:** Miho, I've received a troubling message from Grace.

*Ruby sighs sadly*

**H|Miho Takeda:** Miho ... you've not called me that in a long time.

Yes, I heard about your sister. I don't know much more than you; her mission is classified above my clearance.

I can tell you she was on an active mission, but Grace and the crew of the IEE Bishop are considered missing in action now.

I'm sorry. I know you two were close.

**Ruby Patton:** Did they find the ship?

**H|Miho Takeda:** She sent a report along with the personal message that you received.

The report is very short and has been heavily redacted, but ... we don't think she made it.

I'm sorry, Ruby.

**Ruby Patton:** *Ruby sniffles*

**H|Miho Takeda:** We have just received new orders.

All of my squadrons, including yours, have been moved to the front line against the Dojeer.

Looks like we might be following in Grace's footsteps.

-- pulls herself together

**Ruby Patton:** Thank you, Miho. I just ... thank you.

-- sympathetic

**H|Miho Takeda:** I've sent your mission briefing to your crew.

In addition to your orders, you will also be receiving a new Executive Officer, Rosa Dietrich.

She's green, but she shows a lot of promise.

And Ruby ... again, I'm so sorry for your loss.

Takeda out.

-- Adding DIY screen transition

**Rosa Dietrich:** Squadron Commander, Executive Officer Rosa Dietrich reporting in.

**Ruby Patton:** At ease, Officer. What's the situation report?

**Rosa Dietrich:** It's been rather hectic, Commander. The Dojeer have entered the forward line.

So far they haven't made any hostile movements, but we're scrambling to set up defenses as a precaution.

The command ship that General Takeda sent has been staffed and prepped.

Support is prepared to gather resources for construction.

**Ruby Patton:** Have you received reports from the other squadrons yet?

**Rosa Dietrich:** Ma'am, the other squadrons in the fleet are engaged in other sectors.

We're on our own.

## Level 1 Mission

-- 1 v 1 easy(d1)

## Level 1 Complete

**Rosa Dietrich:** Commander, I am pleased to report that we have destroyed all the hostile enemies.

**Ruby Patton:** Don't get ahead of yourself, Officer. This was just too easy.

Past reports have shown the Dojeer to be tricky opponents with superior technology.

**Rosa Dietrich:** Of course, but we are learning more and more with each battle.

When I first enlisted, I was worried, but now I think we have a real shot at winning this.

**Ruby Patton:** Speaking of enlisting, I heard you were an actress before joining the military.

**Rosa Dietrich:** *Rosa grunts*

Ma'am ... yes, I was, but don't think that makes me unqualified.

-- looks startled

**Ruby Patton:** I ...

**Rosa Dietrich:** I have served on many ships and in many conflicts. I have earned my rank, ma'am.

**Ruby Patton:** *Ruby laughs*

I didn't mean to offend you, Dietrich. Takeda had nothing but high praise for your skills and I trust her judgement.

-- looks sheepish

**Rosa Dietrich:** I'm sorry, Commander, ma'am. I ...

People have a tendency to dismiss me if they know about my past.

I shouldn't have assumed your stance.

-- dismissive gesture

**Ruby Patton:** I understand, Dietrich, and I just wanted to say that you handled yourself well.

You are dismissed.

## Level 2 Prelude

### Chapter 2: Fresh Meat

**H|Miho Takeda:** Patton, Report.

**Ruby Patton:** This sector has been secured, fleet commander.

**H|Miho Takeda:** Nikolai, Report.

**H|Valentina Nikolai:** All hostiles have been removed from the adjacent sector.

**H|Miho Takeda:** Good work, commanders.

Your next mission requires a joint effort.

We have detected a larger presence of Dojeer in the next sector. You two are to secure that sector.

I will be moving into an adjacent sector in hopes of engaging in a pincer attack.

**Ruby Patton:** Any new intelligence on the Dojeer?

**H|Miho Takeda:** Nothing new according to intel.

**Ruby Patton:** And what of the IEE Bishop?

**H|Miho Takeda:** Unfortunately, no new information.

I will let you know if I hear anything, Patton.

Takeda out.

**H|Valentina Nikolai:** Commander, I am very excited to work with you.

I have heard great things about you.

**Ruby Patton:** And I have heard of your unorthodox conquests as well.

**H|Valentina Nikolai:** *Valentina laughs loudly*

Yes, yes, yes. The time I used troopships to take over enemy vessels.

Good times! My team and I are prepared for this mission! If it is our day to die, then it is our day to die!

**Ruby Patton:** I'll see you on the battlefield.

Patton out.

## Level 2 Mission

-- 2 v 2 easy(d2)

## Level 2 Complete

**Rosa Dietrich:** Commander, our sensors have intercepted a message from the Dojeer.

Computer, play message.

**H|Dojeer|Algos:** [Unintelligible]

Grace Patton

[Further unintelligible sounds]

-- startled

**Rosa Dietrich:** Grace Patton?

Your sister?

Why is your sister's name in an alien transmission?

-- looks freaked out

**Ruby Patton:** I ... I don't know.

## Level 3 Prelude

### Chapter 3: Echoes

**H|Miho Takeda:** Commanders, report.

**Valentina Nikolai:** Mission was great success. The enemy is cunning, but we were victorious!

**Ruby Patton:** Our sensors were able to intercept messages from the Dojeer. We have no translations.

**Valentina Nikolai:** The Dojeer say gibberish and we have no way to translate their language. Why bother listening?

-- looks worried

**Ruby Patton:** One of the transmissions said Grace's name.

**H|Miho Takeda:** *Miho grunts*

The IEE have been trying to open up formal communications with the Dojeer, hoping to end this conflict peacefully.

Still, it's disturbing that they know her name.  

*Miho sighs loudly*

Patton, have your sensors continue recording incoming messages from the Dojeer and send them to central command.

We're moving to the next sector. Nikolai, you will move to the adjacent sector, and I will be in the other.

Keep moving forward, Patton.

Takeda out.

## Level 3 Mission

-- 1 v 2 medium(d3) (unallied, e.g. 1v1v1)

## Level 3 Complete

**Rosa Dietrich:** Commander, more messages from the Dojeer incoming.

**H|Dojeer|Algos:** [Angry screeching]

**H|Dojeer|Mati:** [firm but angry talking]

**H|Dojeer|Algos:** [Angrier screeching]

-- the sound of things breaking and shooting starts

**Ruby Patton:** Are they fighting?

What's going on?

## Level 4 Prelude

### Chapter 4: Inevitable

-- looking shaken

**H|Miho Takeda:** Ruby, this is a secure private channel. I've just talked to Nikolai.

I'm going to be honest with you, the situation looks grim.

Our fleet has been doing well on this front, but the other fleets are getting splattered on the metaphorical windshield.

Now to the point. The Imperial Earth Empire has built two 1,000 megaton thermonuclear weapons.

Teller Mark 42.

These bombs are the largest that humanity has ever built. Setting one off could easily destroy a whole planet.

Commander Grace Patton was unable to destroy her target with the payload. It's clear her mission has failed.

We're giving you our last one.

You will be supplied with a modified command ship equipped with anti-radiation chambers.

You and your crew are to take cover in these chambers when you launch the missile.

**Ruby Patton:** Are we trying to take advantage while the Dojeer fight each other?

**H|Miho Takeda:** Exactly.

But, even with this infighting, we don't have the manpower or the resources to maintain this level of conflict. We can't leave our territory vulnerable.

The Dojeer have shown that they will not stop, so drastic measures must be taken.

Central command has informed me that there is a planet deep in Dojeer territory with heavy defences.

You are to fight your way through enemy lines to attack and destroy this planet.

I pray that with Nikolai's support, you will cripple the Dojeer and come back alive.

-- resolute. Salutes Takeda

**Ruby Patton:** I understand. It's been an honor serving with you, Miho.

-- Salutes Patton

**H|Miho Takeda:** The honor is all mine, Ruby.

Next time we see each other, drinks are on me.

**Ruby Patton:** *Ruby laughs quietly*

Only if I get to bring the tea cakes.

**H|Miho Takeda:** Takeda out.

-- FADE

**Ruby Patton:** Alright people. Here are our latest orders ...

## Level 4 Mission

--- 2 v 2 medium(d3)

## Level 4 Complete

**Rosa Dietrich:** Commander, another incoming message from the Dojeer.

**H|Dojeer|Algos:** [Angry unintelligible speech]

**Computer:** Commander, receiving data from central command containing a basic translation algorithm. Integrating translation matrix now.

**H|Dojeer|Algos:** The meat will water my roots and feed my growth! Your planet will become my soil!

-- freaked out

**Ruby Patton:** Well. That's just ... lovely.

## Level 5 Prelude

### Chapter 5: The End of the Beginning

**Rosa Dietrich:** Commander, we seem to have encountered a thinning in the enemy line.

This is our best chance of getting through.

**Ruby Patton:** We're reaching the limit of our live communications signal with the fleet.

Let's take them out as quickly as we can and try to slip through.

Computer, open a channel with Takeda.

**Computer:** Opening channel to Fleet Commander Miho Takeda.

....

....

....

**Computer:** Fleet Commander Miho Takeda's ship is not responding.

**Ruby Patton:** No...

**Rosa Dietrich:** I'm so sorry, ma'am.

**Ruby Patton:** *Ruby whimpers*

Oh Miho.

....

Death lies in our beds: in the lazy mattresses, the black blankets, lives a full stretch and then suddenly blows, blows sound unknown filling out the sheets and there are beds sailing into a harbor where death is waiting, dressed as an admiral.

...

-- After a pause, she tries to pull herself together.

Ready all battle stations and prep the drydocks.

Let's go.

## Level 5 Mission

-- 1 v 1 hard(d4)
-- Start survival mode when less than three ships for the enemy. Victory when your command ship takes damage.

## Level 5 Complete

**Rosa Dietrich:** Ma'am, there's too many of them! We can't hold out much longer!

**H|Grace Patton:** This is the IEE Bishop. We've detected a massive fleet surrounding this sector!

-- joyful

**Ruby Patton:** Gracie, is that you?

-- sounding choked up

**H|Grace Patton:** Yes, it's me.

-- tearing up

**Ruby Patton:** Grace. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I couldn't find you sooner.

-- resolute

**H|Grace Patton:** No. I am the one who will protect you.

There's no time - prepare for a radiological explosion.

Remember this, Ruby - this has happened before and it will happen again.

-- Frantic

**Rosa Dietrich:** She's firing a warhead! It's a Teller Mark 42! Everyone to the radiation chambers!

-- heartbroken

**Ruby Patton:** Gracie!

## Level 6 Prelude

### Chapter 6: Carry On

**Rosa Dietrich:** She did it! She killed them all.

She must have had the other Teller Mark 42 Miho mentioned.

She ... sacrificed herself for us.

-- head in hands

**Ruby Patton:** No, Gracie. Was there no other way?

Gracie ...

Gracie!

**Rosa Dietrich:** Commander, incoming!

## Level 6 Mission

-- 1 v 2 hard(d4)

## Level 6 Complete

**Valentina Nikolai:** Nikolai reporting in!

-- happy. She may have lost her sister and mentor, but she didn't lose everyone else

**Ruby Patton:** Valentina ... I thought we had lost you.

-- looks triumphant

**Valentina Nikolai:** You can't keep a good soldier down!

We were slowed down, but have caught up!

We're prepared to meet you in the next sector!

## Level 7 Prelude

### Chapter 7: Empty Threats

**Rosa Dietrich:** We're detecting a lot of enemies in this sector!

We're receiving a request for communication from ... the Dojeer?

**H|Dojeer|Mati:** Other. You are entering my territory. Turn back or I will destroy you.

-- outraged

**Ruby Patton:** Really? No meat comments or telling us that you will take over our home world?

Your people killed my sister, you monster!

*Ruby lets out a blood curdling yell*

You are the enemy of all humanity and I will contribute to your extinction.

**H|Dojeer|Mati:** I am not your enemy, Other. You have trespassed on my territory.

I may not be able to meet you with my full might, but I am not helpless.

You will not take my territory.

**H|Dojeer|Algos:** The meat intrudes on our battle!

You will not stop my Growth!

I will end you all!

**Rosa Dietrich:** Incoming!

## Level 7 Mission

-- 2 v 3 hard(d4)

## Level 7 Complete

**Valentina Nikolai:** Sector secure! I will take the point for the next sector.

We are approaching the target!

You have the Teller, you must persist.

Effect repairs, join us as soon as you can -  we will make a wide berth for you.

**Ruby Patton:** Good luck, Valentina! Patton out.

## Level 8 Prelude

### Chapter 8: To The Death

**Rosa Dietrich:** There's no sign of Commander Nikolai!

**Ruby Patton:** Valentina ... No. Not you too...

**Rosa Dietrich:** Hostiles incoming!

**H|Dojeer|Algos:** I'll kill you meat ships.

I'll burn your core, Other!

You will not take my soil! I will grow!

## Level 8 Mission

-- 1 v 2 hard(d5)

## Level 8 Complete

**Computer:** Report received from central command. Communication delay of twenty four hours.

Dojeer ships spotted a few sectors from Earth connected wormhole, behind defensive lines.

IEE defenses have scrambled to cut them off.

-- looking exhausted

**Ruby Patton:** There isn't anything we can do about that now. We're too far inside enemy lines.

We can only pray that there will be an Earth to go back to.

-- also looking exhausted

**Rosa Dietrich:** Commander, an incoming communication from the Dojeer!

**Mati:** I am Mati Dojeer.

I am this planet.

Your enemy is my enemy.

Why do you fight me?

-- shocked

**Ruby Patton:** What? Are you saying there are two races of Dojeer?

**Mati:** There are many race hives of Dojeer.

All over the universe.

The one who names you Meat calls itself Algos.

It killed its birthing planet with its greed and gluttony and it seeks a new planet to grow upon.

**Ruby Patton:** You ... you haven't been the one attacking us?

**Mati:** I would not waste my resources so.

**Ruby Patton:** But ... what about ... Grace?

**Mati:** Grace Patton is no more.

**Ruby Patton:** But ... Grace saved me with the bomb.

She died protecting me!

**Mati:** No, Grace died here.

**Rosa Dietrich:** Commander, our sensors just received telemetry for a ship in the sector... it's the IEE Bishop!

The ship ... there's no one left.

**Mati:** Grace stumbled into my territory.

She learned about Algos, but it arrived to take my planet and snuff out my core. My self.

Grace Patton, save me. Wounded and weakened Algos. Drove it away for a while.

**Ruby Patton:** Then who saved me?

**Mati:** Perhaps you did.

**Ruby Patton:** Excuse me?

**Mati:** There is a strange thing that happens in my territory.

A hole in space that comes and goes.

I have been sending my vessels, sprouts of myself through this hole.

I did this because one of those Sprouts came to me first before I had sent any of them through.

-- looking highly skeptical

**Rosa Dietrich:** A wormhole through time. Really?

**Mati:** Take the explosion through this hole.

Destroy Algos core self. It will be a large vessel, heavily guarded.

If you destroy that, you will end it.

All that will be left will be its sprout fleets and they will be far fewer in number than the forces under Algos' direction.

I have sent what I can to cut Algos off from your planet and protect it from any stray fleets that may stumble through it.

**Ruby Patton:** Those ships were yours?

-- Covers her eyes for a moment, grief-stricken. Takes a deep breath and looks up.

...

Yes. Right.

Dietrich.

**Rosa Dietrich:** Ma'am?

**Ruby Patton:** Tear off the hull markings.

Change our identifiers to match the IEE Bishop.

Disconnect the video feed from the communications systems.

**Rosa Dietrich:** What?

**Ruby Patton:** Grace gave her life to give us this opportunity and I don't know what kind of universal laws we might hit in there.

It's better safe than causing a paradox.

**Rosa Dietrich:** Ma'am. I ...

**Ruby Patton:** Rosa, you have been a wonderful Executive Officer. It has been a pleasure working with you.

-- She turns to the rest of her staff.

With all of you. Thank you for giving me the privilege.

**Rosa Dietrich:** Thank you, ma'am. But -

**Ruby Patton:** Please. Trust me, Rosa.

**Rosa Dietrich:** ... I can do that, ma'am.

**Ruby Patton:** A general message to all personnel.

We are about to embark on a very unorthodox mission.

We may or may not survive.

If we survive, we may not be able to return to earth. There isn't exactly a lot of data on time travel after all.

**Rosa Dietrich:** *Rosa muttters*

No kidding.

**Ruby Patton:** There is no shame in staying behind.

Those who wish will be shuttled to the habitat ship to begin transportation back to IEE territory.

Mati, can you arrange an escort for my people to get back to safety?

**Mati:** I can spare those resources.

**Ruby Patton:** Thank you, Mati.

For those who wish to remain, assist with preparations. We'll be heading into the wormhole as soon as we're ready.

Rosa. If you wish to go, I will appoint you Squadron Commander for the duration of the journey and recommend you for permanent promotion.

**Rosa Dietrich:** *Rosa laughs meekly*

Thank you for the offer, Commander, but ...

I won't be leaving.

My place is with you and our crew.

-- looking teary eyed

**Ruby Patton:** Thank you, Rosa. Please ... call me Ruby.

When we're ready, navigate into the wormhole.

## Level 9 Prelude

### Chapter 9: The Beginning of the End

**Computer:** Incoming communication from Fleet Commander Miho Takeda.

**H|Miho Takeda:** Grace? Grace Patton? Is that you?

**Ruby Patton:** Yes.

-- happily

**H|Miho Takeda:** You're ... alive?

It's good to see you, but we've got incoming!

## Level 9 Mission

-- 2 v 3 hard(d5)

## Level 9 Complete

**Rosa Dietrich:** Ruby! The Fleet Commander's ship has been damaged!

**H|Miho Takeda:** Grace ... Ruby has been looking for you.

**Rosa Dietrich:** Ruby ... her ship's gone critical ... it's about to blow!

-- looks devastated

**Ruby Patton:** Miho, I'm sorry. I ... couldn't save you.

-- shocked

**H|Miho Takeda:** Ruby?

Is that you?

**Ruby Patton:** Miho ...

-- An explosion whites out the cameras

**Rosa Dietrich:** Takeda's command ship has exploded.

They ... they're dead. All of them.

-- ruby covers her face

-- Screen fade to Black

**Rosa Dietrich:** We're approaching the target sector. Incoming message!

-- The following text must be exactly the same at the end

**Future Ruby Patton|Ruby Patton:** This is the IEE Bishop. We've detected a massive fleet surrounding this sector!

**H|Past Ruby Patton|Grace Patton:** Gracie, is that you?

**Future Ruby Patton|Ruby Patton:** Yes. It's me.

**H|Past Ruby Patton|Grace Patton:** Grace. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I couldn't find you sooner.

**Future Ruby Patton|Ruby Patton:** No. I am the one who will protect you.

There's no time - prepare for a radiological explosion.

Remember this, Ruby - this has happened before and it will happen again.

-- The previous text must be exactly the same at the end

**Rosa Dietrich:** Communications ended. The Algos core is in sight.

**Ruby Patton:** Detonate the Teller.

## Epilogue

### Epilogue

-- A speech given by Valentina Nikolai at the unveiling of the Dojeer War memorial in D.C. (Suggest artwork to with voiceover. Artwork with crossfade over each other.)

-- First picture is is Nikolai in military formal dress, standing at a podium in front of a crowd. Behind her is a tarp covering a large block shape

**Valentina Nikolai:** Thank you for joining me today for the Dojeer War Memorial.

**Valentina Nikolai:** I served under Fleed Commander Miho Takeda. Miho, as she asked us to call her.

**H|Valentina Nikolai|Miho Takeda:** She said that titles were for work, not tea and poetry.

She led us well, but also helped us grow as people. To me, her loss cuts deep.

To me, she is face of everyone we lose in this war.

-- Possible image, Ruby and Miho over tea, laughing

**H|Valentina Nikolai|Rosa Dietrich:** But, war is not the end. Thanks to Miho Takeda, Commander Ruby Patton and Executive Officer Rosa Dietrich, the war is over.

We are regrouping, rebuilding and learning.

-- possible image, shot of multiple IEE Command ships building, among them are Dejeer ships

**H|Valentina Nikolai|Mati:** We are learning that we do not know very much about the Dojeer. Some might even be friends.

-- possible shot, a Mati Dojeer drone standing in the crowd, looking pensive

I wish we could have known this all before.

I can only hope that Miho, Ruby, Rosa and so many others didn't die in vain.

I wish that we had met Mati first and not Algos.

Wishes don't change life and we will all be grieving for very long time.

-- Fade to shot of Miho's husband sitting in his home, looking at a picture of Miho. Ruby's parents hugging each other and crying

**H|Valentina Nikolai|Ruby Patton:** And while we grieve, we also sing. We have a future to live in.

We have friends and loved ones to hold that we thought we lost.

-- fade to shot of habitat ship, escorted by Dojeer and IEE ships, arriving at earth

So. We live. We grow. We work to meet the next challenge that life throws our way.

We are humans.

We will always fight.

-- possible ending. a shot of Ruby's name on the memorial, camera shift to make the reflection in the memorial come into focus. The person looking at the the name is Ruby herself.
